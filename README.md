API to google calendar chrome extension

## Documentation:

Documentation will be added as soon as can be possible.

## Extra info:

authorization and authentication files: credentials.json and token.json from google OAuth2.0 client is not on repository. They are sensitive files as they give access to personal info (credential-owner's google calendar). But feel free to explore the implementation in the index.mjs file.
